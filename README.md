### Hey, I‚Äôm Gabriel
- üîµ I was (from April 24 to October 24) a quantitative researcher intern at Milliman Paris. I essentially developped closed formula to plug-in into a specific class of machine learning models to create alpha from climate data on market stocks and improved significatively the corresponding PnL.
- üå± I'm graduated from ENS Paris Saclay in the MVA master's program (2024) and an engineer graduated from ESTP (2022) as well as an M1 in mathematics from Sorbonne University.
- ‚ô¶Ô∏è Recipient of the Google DeepMind Excellence Scolarschip (2023-2024).
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in machine learning and applied mathematics. Particularly in the links between theory and practice, in particular putting theoretical machine learning algorithms into production for real-life cases.
- üéí I am also very involved in teaching mathematics and computer science (from high school to Master's level). I'm oral examinator (in french kholleur) in mathematics for the preparatory class (PC*) at Fenelon St Marie.
