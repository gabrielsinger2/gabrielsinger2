### Hey, I’m Gabriel
- 🔵 I was ML quantitative researcher at Milliman Paris for 6 months.
- 🌱 I'm graduated from ENS Paris Saclay in the MVA master's program (2024) and an engineer graduated from ESTP (2022) as well as an M1 in mathematics from Sorbonne University.
- ♦️ Recipient of the Google DeepMind Excellence Scolarschip (2023-2024).
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and applied mathematics. Particularly in the links between theory and practice, in particular putting theoretical machine learning algorithms into production for real-life cases.
- 🎒 I am also very involved in teaching mathematics and computer science (from high school to Master's level).
