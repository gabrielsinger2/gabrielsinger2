### Hey, I’m Gabriel
- 🔵🔵 I am a junior machine learning engineer at Huawei Paris in the times series teams, working on developping new architectures based on Transformers, worked on model compression, distillation and foundation models.
- 🔵 I was (from April 24 to October 24) a machine learning researcher intern at Milliman Paris. I essentially developped closed formula to plug-in into a specific class of machine learning models to create alpha from climate data on market stocks and improved significatively the corresponding PnL.
- 🌱 I'm graduated from ENS Paris Saclay in the MVA master's program (2024) and an engineer graduated from ESTP (2022) as well as an M1 in mathematics from Sorbonne University.
- ♦️ Recipient of the Google DeepMind Excellence Scolarschip (2023-2024).
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, in particular putting theoretical machine learning algorithms into production for real-life cases.
- 🎒 I am also very involved in teaching mathematics and computer science (from high school to Master's level) and volunteer contributor to the mathematical exercises on the [BIBMATH](https://www.bibmath.net/ressources/index.php?action=affiche&quoi=mathspe/index)

I'm sharing a lovely quote from one of my favorite mathematicians, Alexandre Grothendieck. He wrote "Récoltes et Semailles" ("Harvest and Sowing" in english), a philosophical work in which he describes in particular his relationship to mathematics and research in general, and especially to the notion of discovery. Intrerested readers can find the book on free access at [Récoltes et Semailles](https://agrothendieck.github.io/divers/ReS.pdf). 

"La découverte est le privilège de l’enfant. C’est du petit enfant que je veux parler, l’enfant
qui n’a pas peur encore de se tromper, d’avoir l’air idiot, de ne pas faire sérieux, de ne pas faire
comme tout le monde. Il n’a pas peur non plus que les choses qu’il regarde aient le mauvais
goût d’être différentes de ce qu’il attend d’elles, de ce qu’elles devraient être, ou plutôt : de
ce qu’il est bien entendu qu’elles sont. Il ignore les consensus muets et sans failles qui font
partie de l’air que nous respirons — celui de tous les gens sensés et bien connus comme tels." Alexandre Grothendick, Récoltes et Semailles.
