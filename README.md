### Hey, I’m Gabriel

- ♦️ Recipient of the Google DeepMind Excellence Scolarschip
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, machine learning and applied mathematics. Particularly in the links between theory and practice, in particular putting theoretical machine learning algorithms into production for real-life cases.
- 🎒 I am also very involved in teaching mathematics and computer science (from high school to Master's level).
