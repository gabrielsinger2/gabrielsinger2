### Hey, I‚Äôm Gabriel
- üå± I'm a final year student at ENS Paris Saclay in the MVA master's program and an engineer graduated from ESTP (2022) as well as an M1 in mathematics from Sorbonne University.
- ‚ô¶Ô∏è Recipient of the Google DeepMind Excellence Scolarschip
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in machine learning and applied mathematics. Particularly in the links between theory and practice, in particular putting theoretical machine learning algorithms into production for real-life cases.
- üéí I am also very involved in teaching mathematics and computer science (from high school to Master's level).
- üì´ How to reach me: gabrielsinger2@gmail.com
