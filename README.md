### Hey, I‚Äôm Gabriel
- üîµüîµ I was (from December 24 to Septembre 25) a machine learning researcher at Huawei Paris in the times series teams, working on developping new architectures based on Transformers, worked on model compression, distillation and foundation models.
- üîµ I was (from April 24 to October 24) a machine learning researcher intern at Milliman Paris. I essentially developped closed formula to plug-in into a specific class of machine learning models to create alpha from climate data on market stocks and improved significatively the corresponding PnL.
- üå± I'm graduated from ENS Paris Saclay in the MVA master's program (2024) and an engineer graduated from ESTP (2022) as well as an M1 in mathematics from Sorbonne University.
- ‚ô¶Ô∏è Recipient of the Google DeepMind Excellence Scolarschip (2023-2024).
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in machine learning, in particular putting theoretical machine learning algorithms into production for real-life cases.
- üéí I am also very involved in teaching mathematics and computer science (from high school to Master's level). I'm oral examinator (in french kholleur) in mathematics for the preparatory class (PC*) at Fenelon St Marie.
- :triangular_ruler: I'm a volunteer contributor to the mathematical exercises on the [BIBMATH](https://www.bibmath.net/ressources/index.php?action=affiche&quoi=mathspe/index)

I'm sharing a lovely quote from one of my favorite mathematicians, Alexandre Grothendieck. He wrote "R√©coltes et Semailles" ("Harvest and Sowing" in english), a philosophical work in which he describes in particular his relationship to mathematics and research in general, and especially to the notion of discovery. Intrerested readers can find the book on free access at [R√©coltes et Semailles](https://agrothendieck.github.io/divers/ReS.pdf). 

"La d√©couverte est le privil√®ge de l‚Äôenfant. C‚Äôest du petit enfant que je veux parler, l‚Äôenfant
qui n‚Äôa pas peur encore de se tromper, d‚Äôavoir l‚Äôair idiot, de ne pas faire s√©rieux, de ne pas faire
comme tout le monde. Il n‚Äôa pas peur non plus que les choses qu‚Äôil regarde aient le mauvais
go√ªt d‚Äô√™tre diff√©rentes de ce qu‚Äôil attend d‚Äôelles, de ce qu‚Äôelles devraient √™tre, ou plut√¥t : de
ce qu‚Äôil est bien entendu qu‚Äôelles sont. Il ignore les consensus muets et sans failles qui font
partie de l‚Äôair que nous respirons ‚Äî celui de tous les gens sens√©s et bien connus comme tels." Alexandre Grothendick, R√©coltes et Semailles.
